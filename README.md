# iOS Private Framework

![Apple's Private Frameworks for iOS](https://cdn.netmotionsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iOS-Apple.png)

This repo contains reversed-engendered private frameworks used by Apple in iOS.

Private frameworks are frameworks which you are not allowed to use.
They are not expected to be used outside of Apple, hence "Private". They are often lower-level libraries which may "break" the system if not used correctly.

## Why?
For research purposes ðŸ™‚
